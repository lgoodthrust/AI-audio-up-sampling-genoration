Welcome to the AI-audio-up-sampling-genoration Project!

No its not a wiki, its just a random pile of stuff about the project... It will not be organized what so ever >:3

This model is simply a fun side project for me to explore my fascination with AI technology.
As some of you might understand, AI is the next big frontier, waiting to be explored and understood.
I simply want to contribute and explore what I can while there is still an unknown.  
I know python isn't the most "efficient language" to lean in, but It detailed, popular, and relatively adaptable. 
If you want to use my code I don't mind at all, I just ask that you give credit where do.
